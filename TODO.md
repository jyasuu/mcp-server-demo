## clone @rust-sdk/examples/servers/src/counter_streamhttp.rs by first

## features tools 

### implement ping pong tool

### implement get current time tool with with various different formats

### implement tool support Encrypt clear text and decrypt ciphertext using crypto algorithms like AES, TripleDES, Rabbit or RC4.

### implement base64 en/decode tool support Simply encode and decode strings into their base64 representation.

### implement token generator tool

### implement Password strength analyser tool

### implement JWT parser tool

### implement Hash text tool support multiple digest encoding and Hash a text string using the function you need : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA224, SHA512, SHA384, SHA3 or RIPEMD160

### implement Bcrypt tool support Hash and compare text string using bcrypt. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function based on the Blowfish cipher.

### implement tool support A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. The number of possible UUIDs is 16^32, which is 2^128 or about 3.4x10^38 (which is a lot!).
